\def A set $G$ is a *group* under a binary operation $\cdot: G \times G \to G$
	\iff closure: $\forall a,b \in G: a \cdot b \in G$

\def An *abelian group* \pred is a group whose operation is commutative.
\thm If $|G|$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic.

\thm *Lagrange's theorem:* $|H|$ divides $|G|$.

\def A set $H$ is a *normal subgroup* of $G$
	\iff $H \trianglelefteq G$
	\iff left cosets coincide with right cosets: $H \le G$, $\forall g \in G: gH = Hg$
	\iff $H$ is invariant under conjugation: $H \le G$, $\forall g \in G: \forall h \in H: ghg^{-1} \in H$
	\iff $H \le G$, $H$ is a union of conjugacy classes
		\footnote this is always the case
	\iff the set of cosets of $H$ forms a group, called the *quotient group*, $G/H = \{ Hg \,\|\, g \in G \}$, under the group operation $(Ha)(Hb) = H(ab)$ with the identity $H$

\def $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq X$ are *separated* \iff $\bar{A} \cap B = A \cap \bar{B} = \varnothing$.

# Gradient descent
Suppose we want to minimize $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$. The gradient descent algorithm initializes a guess $\mathbf{x}$ and repeatedly moves along the negative gradient at $\mathbf{x}$, i.e. repeatedly sets $\mathbf{x}$ to be $\mathbf{x} - \alpha \nabla f(\mathbf{x})$ for some learning rate $\alpha$, until convergence. The learning rate can be continually adjusted, perhaps to guarantee that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is smaller than it was.

# Newton's method
Suppose we want to find a zero of $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. Newton's method initializes a guess $x$ and then repeatedly sets $x$ to be the zero of the linear approximation of $f$ at $x$, i.e. repeatedly sets $x$ to be $x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}$, until convergence.
	
Suppose we want to minimize or maximize $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$. Then we can apply Newton's method to $\nabla f$, where we repeatedly set \[
	\mathbf{x} \leftarrow \mathbf{x} - \left(Hf(\mathbf{x}) \right)^{-1} \nabla f(\mathbf{x}),
\] where $Hf$ is the Hessian matrix of second derivatives.

We want to minimize the following:
	- energy ($E$)
	- enthalpy ($H$)
		Note that the enthalpy is minimized when the energy is minimized!
	- Gibbs free energy ($G$)


\thm $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq X$ are *separated* \iff $\bar{A} \cap B = A \cap \bar{B} = \varnothing$.
