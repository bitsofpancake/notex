\def A set $G$ is a *group* under a binary operation $\cdot: G \times G \to G$
	\iff closure: $\forall a,b \in G: a \cdot b \in G$

\def An *abelian group* \pred is a group whose operation is commutative.
\thm If $|G|$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic.

\thm *Lagrange's theorem:* $|H|$ divides $|G|$.

\def A set $H$ is a *normal subgroup* of $G$
	\iff $H \normalsubgroupof G$
	\iff left cosets coincide with right cosets: $H \le G$, $\forall g \in G: gH = Hg$
	\iff $H$ is invariant under conjugation: $H \le G$, $\forall g \in G: \forall h \in H: ghg^{-1} \in H$
	\iff $H \le G$, $H$ is a union of conjugacy classes
		\footnote this is always the case
	\iff the set of cosets of $H$ forms a group, called the *quotient group*, $G/H = \{ Hg \st g \in G \}$, under the group operation $(Ha)(Hb) = H(ab)$ with the identity $H$
	\if 
	\then 

\def $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq X$ are *separated* \iff $\bar{A} \intersect B = A \intersect \bar{B} = \varnothing$.

# Gradient descent of $f$
Suppose we want to minimize $f : \R^d \to \R$. The *gradient*.
	
## Linear regression
Suppose we want to model $f$. Define an affine estimator with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ \[
	f(x) = \alpha + \langle \beta, \vecb{x} \rangle
\]
\footnote There is a problem here
where we the function as $f$.

We want to minimize the following:
	- energy ($E$)
	- enthalpy ($H$)
		Note that the enthalpy is minimized when the energy is minimized!
	- Gibbs free energy ($G$)


\thm $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq X$ are *separated* \iff $\bar{A} \intersect B = A \intersect \bar{B} = \varnothing$.

# Personal pronouns
First are personal pronouns:
	ég: I
	þú: you
	hann/hún/það: he/she/it
	við: we
	þið: you pl.
	þeir/þær/þau: they
		\note this is tricky
